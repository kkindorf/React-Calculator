# React-Calculator

## Overview
I'm currently working through FreeCodeCamp's frontend development curriculum and I had just finished Thinkful's Web Development Bootcamp program 
when I started working on this project. I had been wanting to build this calculator for a long time but I wanted to put my own twist to it. 
I decided to use React as my framework for building the application because I wanted an excuse to continue developing my experience with React.
I think after building the whole project, I would definitely use React again for an application that required similiar functionality. React's functional programming
approach made the code, in my opinion, very easy to understand and read as I was going along. And having easy to read code was very important
for this project because I ran into quite a few unexpected edge cases for my equation string that I was not expecting when I first got started
with this project. 

## Component Breakdown
Developing the components for this project was pretty straightforward. I decided it would make sense to create all of my butons as seperate stateless components.
By doing that, it was easier to create seperate functions for each type of button inside the calculator component that contained all of my state. Having this type of seperation made 
working on this application very fun and I think prevented a lot of unnecessary headaches. 

## Styling and Screenshots
I'm a fan of simple styles that don't cause distractions. So I stuck with the basics. I found a relatively soft red that paired nicely with a darker gray. 
I didn't go crazy finding the perfect font for this application simply because I wasn't interested in finding an incredible calculator font.
I was more focused on creating a smooth user experience that handled as many edge cases as possible to prevent unexpected behavior and I believe
I achieved that.

This image displays how the equation and current value being entered look on the calculator's display screen. I decided to go this direction
because I thought it was easy to read and it was also easy to follow what the equation was doing. The total result after the equation is completed
will only be displayed in the larger font.
